goamumag is a front-end for micromagnetic simulation programs
written by Arne Vansteenkiste at Ghent University

To use it, you need to implement a go struct satisfying the sim.Device interface.
The "device" could represent a CPU, GPU or java virtual machine running amumag.

We plan to use this front-end in a ready-to-use micromagnetic simulation program
which will be available on http://dynamat.ugent.be/simulations.

This source code is released to be in compliance with my previous assignment
which stated that it would be open-sourced. This branch is however not maintained
as such, but merged into the code available on the above-mentioned site.
Please look there for the last version and usable derived programs.
